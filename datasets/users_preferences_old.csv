The ingredients of this amazing butter sauce are still a secret till today. Four generations later, Mr. François Vouillamoz, the current owner of the original Entrecôte Café de Paris Chez Boubier 1930 restaurant in Geneva is the only person in the world who holds the secret of the “Café de Paris” sauce as it was originated in 1930 and he blends it discretely at his kitchen laboratory underneath his restaurant.

627,Mezoi3,,,,," The Sauce “Café de Paris” was developed by Chef Boubier in 1930 who gifted its secret recipe to his daughter and her husband Mr. Arthur Dumont, owners of “Café de Paris” restaurant in 26 Rue Mont Blanc Geneva; thus enabled them in 1942 to launch an astonishing single menu formula, consisting of a Green Salad, 180 grams of Entrecote Steak with “Café de Paris” sauce and French Fries. The ingredients of this amazing butter sauce are still a secret till today. Four generations later, Mr. François Vouillamoz, the current owner of the original Entrecôte Café de Paris Chez Boubier 1930 restaurant in Geneva is the only person in the world who holds the secret of the “Café de Paris” sauce as it was originated in 1930 and he blends it discretely at his kitchen laboratory underneath his restaurant. You can now taste the original “Café de Paris” sauce specially flown by plane from Geneva exclusively to our franchised restaurants in MENA in Riyadh, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Al Ain, Sharjah and Al Ula."

840,rominadarvish,"Tehran, Tehran Province",,,," The Sauce “Café de Paris” was developed by Chef Boubier in 1930 who gifted its secret recipe to his daughter and her husband Mr. Arthur Dumont, owners of “Café de Paris” restaurant in 26 Rue Mont Blanc Geneva; thus enabled them in 1942 to launch an astonishing single menu formula, consisting of a Green Salad, 180 grams of Entrecote Steak with “Café de Paris” sauce and French Fries. The ingredients of this amazing butter sauce are still a secret till today. Four generations later, Mr. François Vouillamoz, the current owner of the original Entrecôte Café de Paris Chez Boubier 1930 restaurant in Geneva is the only person in the world who holds the secret of the “Café de Paris” sauce as it was originated in 1930 and he blends it discretely at his kitchen laboratory underneath his restaurant. You can now taste the original “Café de Paris” sauce specially flown by plane from Geneva exclusively to our franchised restaurants in MENA in Riyadh, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Al Ain, Sharjah and Al Ula."

The ingredients of this amazing butter sauce are still a secret till today. Four generations later, Mr. François Vouillamoz, the current owner of the original Entrecôte Café de Paris Chez Boubier 1930 restaurant in Geneva is the only person in the world who holds the secret of the “Café de Paris” sauce as it was originated in 1930 and he blends it discretely at his kitchen laboratory underneath his restaurant.
